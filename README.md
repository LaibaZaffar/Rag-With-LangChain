# Rag-With-LangChain
This project designs and implements a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system for answering clinical queries and generating informative summaries using the MIMIC-IV-Ext Direct dataset. The system leverages a retrieval component to find relevant documents and a generative model to produce context-aware responses.
